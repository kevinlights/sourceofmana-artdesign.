Growl.

I saw the best players of my generation destroyed by
madness, sitting in hurnscald naked,
dragging themselves through the forest at dawn
looking for an angry mushroom,
pink-haired archers burning for the heavenly mana world
connection to the starry server in the grinding machinery,
beggars at the rare store, hollow-eyed and high sat
pachua smoking in the desert floating across the caves
contemplating snake skins,
who bared their brains to trolls in terranite territories and
saw mouboo angels staggering on tulimshar roofs illuminated,
who passed through caves in nivalis with determined eyes
hallucinating cindy and tragedy among warriors,
expelled by yetis, pining for the fjords,
shouting obscene all-caps about lag,
who cowered in the caretakers cabin, burning their money
on hats and ores and listening to the tedious talk,
who got busted speaking spanish in public places returning from
tulimshar with arrows and monster point rewards,
who ate apples in the mine or drank cactus potions in
dimonds inn, killed in the t-cave night after night,
with dreams, with concentration potions, with fallen nightmares,
potions and bones and endless trolling,
tulimshar streets of shuddering storms and
#ingrav of the mind leaping toward snakes and scorpions,
the motionless maggot, dark green quest and sagathas tree and
cemetery dawns, iron potion drunkenness over the rooftops,
storebots, more botters and light green pants,
flickering candle helmets, light path and dark path of magic,
soundscape in the roaring winter dusks of nivalis,
arkim ranting and kind gms of mana,
who chained themselves to rules for the endless
ride from afk to death until the noise of spam and insults
brought them down shuddering, all drained of brilliance,
in the drear light of hurnscald town center,
who sat all night listening to the crackhats,
to the jukebox of complaints, yacketayakking
screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories
and anecdotes and shocks of being banned and guild wars,
who vanished into nowhere leaving a rare collection behind,
who wandered around and around the sick child in tulimshar,
wondering what to do, and went, leaving no broken hearts,
who studied life magic from elanore by the pond
who disappeared into the snake pit
leaving, weeping, undressing, skeletons shrieking with delight

etc etc etc?

well... everything considered, there are good things too!
friends and mouboos, we bask in their golden radiance,
finally finding a four-leaf clover, screenshot moments of joyplim..
there are lots of things that could be better, and some things are best ignored,
but the good parts can outweigh them all.
