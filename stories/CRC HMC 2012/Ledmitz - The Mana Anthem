The Mana Anthem

Beyond the yonder hills of real,
There is a place of tempered steel,
Knives of rock and bones alike,
A battle field, and more reveals.

Arrows whoosh from every way,
Lightning blasting. Some; Dismay,
The healing then, makes all, alright,
To drag undead? Another day.

To which witch or wizard then,
Shall be the chosen for revenge?
Havoc reaped in deep, dark caves,
Rivalry fought until the end.

To Soul Menhirs, all give thanks!
Praise that stone, for through the ranks,
Life and time; immortal days,
Making all, never dank.

Praise be to all thine deities!
Creating all there is to see,
Mesmerizing, it may be,
In this world... I'm truly free.
