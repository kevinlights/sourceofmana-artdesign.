Play Play Play

The whole day I stay,
I play and play and play.
Nothing that happens here
can make me go away.
The laundry and dishes,
they can wait another day,
and if I start to level,
they’re neglected anyway.

But most importantly
there are the things I get online.
A better item I can use
or longer share of time.
I’d care more for my family
if only they would play.
I’d give them gifts and warps and things,
to help improve their day.

And why my boss complains to me
I still don’t understand.
I’m feeling pretty happy
when I live in mana land.
I never see the nastiness
that happens on the street,
and anyone that talks to me
are friends I’d like to meet.

So take away the real world
and leave the mana one.
The one where my existence
is a joy, and pain is gone.
The one where I can daydream,
the one where I feel tough.
The one I live my fantasies
until it logs me off.
