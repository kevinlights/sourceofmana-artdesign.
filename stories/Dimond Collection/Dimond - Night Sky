Night Sky

Dark night though so bright.
With an amazing gaze I see the bright moon that glows and brings beauty beautifully.
The stars have a magical spark each different each unique in the brightly night sky.
You dance on the nightly sky, so lightly you touch a softness of utter happiness.
I love the brightly lit light in the night and then I say good-night at every night.

Cherish every night like your last for every night is special for not everything stays like always.
