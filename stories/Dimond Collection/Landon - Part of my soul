Part Of My Soul

On September 29th our souls did meet,
the Lord blessed me with a feeling so deep.
She took my heart into to her hands
and took me off to an angelic land;

I swear I could have not been happier than I was
until sadness took me up in the form of a flood.
I was washed to confusion, my heart bursted with rage
like an animal trapped in a small cage.

I don't know where I am, its cold and dark
my feelings so far apart.
I climbed the walls of despair
and picked up a scent in the air,
it was the scent of my long lost prayer,

It is my rope and my strength,
its everything that places the bad beneath.
It picked me up and separated my pain,
and knew my feelings for her was not in vane.

Poem to my now fiance.
