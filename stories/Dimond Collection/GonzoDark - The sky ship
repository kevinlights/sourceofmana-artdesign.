The sky ship

The sky ship lets its long veins rush through the cloud mass, and allows the ship to glide forward as light as a feather towards the future.
The empty space above throws stars past me, and in between those stars lays a dream of a perfect life with her by my side.
Will I ever get to show her my flame, my Olympic fire, my desire for more than just a simple friendship?
I suddenly feel a divine warmth, a soft grasp of love that spreads throughout my entire body, at last is she mine.
An equivocal feeling spreads in my stomach, is this, the sign I have been looking for since the dawn of time?
I ignore for a while her eyes that have feel on my face, that observe every move I make.
I should see her as a friend, but I see her as my one and everything, why does Amor shot me in the chest all the time?
Will a though get better if two people share it? And do I think the same thing as you do?
Suddenly the bottom falls out, we both fall through the haze and the only thing that holds us together is our hand tied together.
The wind is buzzing in my ears, our clothes flaps load, and my eyewash is blown away, as fast as it is coming out.
I feel her arms around my body, and at last I felt that we where both hugging each other.
The winds howling stopped, the noise from our clothes stopped, and I heard her whisper into my ear "I have always loved you".
