Like a touched rose

Love makes you addicted
Hurts you when you don't get enough
Gives you a satisfied rush when you receive it
Love knocks out all the senses
And makes you only experience it
Love is like a rose floating on water
Beautiful to look at
But if you touch it, it stabs you, and it sinks
And then you are hurt and you lost the one thing you where after
