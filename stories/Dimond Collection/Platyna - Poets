Poets

The truth is that no poet ever knows what he is writing about...
Words are imperfect.
Too imperfect to

Describe.
Imperfection of air
Imperfection of love

Imperfection
Lives in us.
It craves to consume us transparently...

Yet...
Words are created in a perfect trance...
Named a poet.
An acrobat balancing on the border of daub.

Platyna, 2008
