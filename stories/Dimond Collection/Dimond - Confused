Confused

The emotion of confusing is in your path no doubt about that.
It starts conflicts it starts to make you mad.
People don't think confusing is a looming shadow in life.
It's more likely they are thinking of death as the shadow tonight.
Confusing it is for confused is when it has happened in the cruel life.
You can't stop it you can't know when it will happen.
It starts conflicts even wars just a little confusing things go wrong.
The emotion of confusing is hard to explain, but this is one way.
That's all I have to say.
