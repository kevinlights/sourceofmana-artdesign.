Dawn and Sunrise in the Snowy Mountains

A few thin strips of fleecy clouds lie long
And motionless above the eastern steeps,
Like shreds of silver lace: till suddenly.
out from the flushing centre to the ends
On either hand, their lustrous layers become
Dipped all in crimson streaked with pink and gold,
And then, at last, are edged with a band
Of crystal fire. And now, even long before
The sun himself is seen, off tow'rds the west
A range of mighty summits, more and more,
Blaze, each like huge cresset, in the keen
Clear atmosphere. As if the Spirit of Light,
Advancing swiftly thence, and eastwards still,
Kept kindling them in a quick succession;-till
The universal company of cones
And pyramidal peaks, stand burning all
With rosy fires, like wide ranging circ
Of God-great altars,-and even so announce
The sun that is now, with a vast flash, is seen
pushing his rim above yon central height.
So they forth at dawn; at eve the sun,
That rose behind them as they journeyed out,
Was firing with his nether rim a range
Of unknown mountains, that like ramparts towered
Full in their front; and his last glances fell
Into gloomy forest's eastern glades
In golden gleams, like to the Angel's sword,
and flashed upon the windings of a creek
That noiseless ran betwixt the pioneers
And those new Appennines- ran, shaded o'er
With boughs of the wind willow, handing mixed
From either bank, or duskily befringed
With upwards tapering feathery swamp-oaks,
The sylvan eyelash always of remote
Australian waters.
