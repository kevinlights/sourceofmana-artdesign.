Where is my soul placed?

The soul is my fortress
It's purpose is to strengthen me
The soul is an invincible positive invisible energy
That will always be constant
The soul is the experiences bank
That is always open to reflect on

Soul
Where are you, my faithful esquire?
My personality arose from your hand
I can't touch you, nor see.
Maybe I should consider you as monism
An entwined soul and body

You are me and I am you
We are one and the same
I am sitting here and writing about you
And you at the same time
Are you in my head?
Are you the one that controls me?

If I get life from you, and you from me
Do you then hide in my hearth?
The place where I get my life energy from
And if that is true, do you then die with me, when I pass on?
Or do we follow each other out of the empty shell?
Where are you? You are me, you are here!
