Between spring and summer

discovering the world
all those little creatures
please be careful
now it's clear though
it's been raining so
they're everywhere now
don't want to step on them but
they're everywhere 'cause
it's been raining but
now it's clear so
please be careful
all those little creatures
discovering the world
