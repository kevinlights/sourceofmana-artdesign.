Valentine

There was a young lady so furious
Only grinding was making her curious
Once she reached ninety nine
There was nothing to grind
And she's found the whole journey injurious

There once was a wizard so silly
His sweetheart was nice as a lily
But he summoned a devil
And that one had some revel
After which there was noone to kill it

There was a young woman in black
Who had heart many wanted to crack
She casted some magic
The outcome was tragic
Those heros have never came back

There once was a young girl so nice
She was nothing but sugar and spice
Once I've heard her sweet voice
I had no other choice
But to save her from cold caves of ice
