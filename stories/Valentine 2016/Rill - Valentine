Valentine

Here's a ManaWorld Valentine
Which I hope you will not decline
Won't you come out and play?
Join the game, and then stay
For the friends and the fun are so fine!

In ManaWorld, love's in the air
Cupid's arrows are everywhere
Give your sweetheart a kiss
Since it pays to know this:
Love is better than any rare!

In Hurnscald, it's Valentine's Day
Time for fun and frolic and play
At Blossom's flower shop
Buy some roses to drop
And see smiles when you give them away!

There once was a newbie named Cal
Who was looking to find a nice gal
Though a kindly young lad
His eyesight was bad
And he got stuck with a yeti named Hal

There once was a mouboo named Stu
Who actually hadn't a clue
One Valentine's Day
He thought he was gay
But really, he just had the flu

There once was a player from France
Who went looking for some romance
Then in one Illia fight
Luvia gave him a fright
And he knew it was love at first glance

There once was a pollet named Dave
Who loved a pinkie named Maeve
On Valentine's Day
He swept her away
And they married in Arkim's cave

There once was a mage named Flo
Who was hoping to find a beau
Then on one blind date
Krukan sealed her fate
Because he had her at "hello"

In Hurnscald, there lived a young slob
Too lazy to get a good job
But Gina was smitten
The love bug had bitten
Since she thought that he looked like a swab

CRC went to Candor for fun
And many a battle they won
But on Valentine's Day
They all stayed away
Writing limericks, which had to get done!
