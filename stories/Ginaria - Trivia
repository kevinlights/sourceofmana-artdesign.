Trivia

I wake up at Mana World to see,
as suddenly my antenna whispers me,
"a mysterious essence is at town",
so i am jumping up and down.
It must be Platyna, she is back,
some Pinkys get a heart attack.
Is she the one,
who summons Pinkys for fun?
I hope not,
where is her spot.
There she is, a crown is at her head,
but is she worth that?
She is an admin and admins should act wise,
so a trivia would be nice.
Its a well idea,
because we will see,
how crazy stuff she must learn,
so we sit near the tree fern.
Trivias are always funny,
like a honey bunny.
Our brains will getting hot,
buy solving the Gordian knot.
More and more coming to town,
and sit down.
Curious like i am,
i am waiting now on my biology exam.
