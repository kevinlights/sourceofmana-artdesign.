MrWho 2

When first I met the awesome guy I know as MrWho,
I knew as soon as I said hi that he was quite cool, too.
It's hard to be so cool as I, and I was fair amazed -
but though RL I gave a sigh, in game I was unfazed.

"You think you're cool," I said to him, "I think you're mistaken.
Your cool disguise is wearing thin, I'm fair sure you're fakin'."
But MrWho said with a grin - and lowering his shades,
"I'm by far the coolest guy in Heaven, Earth or Hades."

"Don't lie," said I to MrWho'd kept grinning all this time,
(Forgive me if I say to you that here I forced a rhyme),
"Then I shall prove it - prove it's true," said MrWho to me,
I said "Pfft!" - which was rather rude - and then "Well, we shall see."

He grinned and looked me in the eye as he stood up and said,
"Yo people - who's the coolest guy was ever born and bred?"
"YOU ARE!" resounded their reply... I said, with bravado
I didn't care it wasn't I, wasn't Enchilado.
