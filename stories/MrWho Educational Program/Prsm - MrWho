MrWho

At first i thought mrwho was a tool
now i know, he's just a fool
this idea to make himself feel so cool
now he is just back to being a tool!

I watch him play tmw game
and his verbal quotes are just lame
i watch him try to flirt with all the dames
he makes me want to hang my head in shame

if he was just a little older
perhaps his wit would be a tad bolder
instead i feel i am getting colder
with this person, who acts like a pot holder

the time has come to say good bye
its time for me to get very high
i can't see any one else, that wants to spread his lies
for poor mrwho, this trolling guy
