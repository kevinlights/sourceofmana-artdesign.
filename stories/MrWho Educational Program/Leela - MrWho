MrWho

He likes purple very much
that is why he's wearing it
his clothes, you should never touch
or he will cry so hard a bit

Trolling is his favourite sport
You should sometimes see
People just cry out: "oh Lord!"
And they don't do that with glee.

Now, MrWho, I will troll you
I can do that like you, too
That was a lie, that was not true
Leela never trolls MrWho

I want the money, my poem's the best
give me the gold, don't read the rest
everyone else should not get a chance
If I get the money, I will dance!

Leela, 2010
