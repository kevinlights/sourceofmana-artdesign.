MrWho

I thought I'd write a poem 'bout a guy called MrWho,
and although it wasn't easy, I had fun, I'm telling you.
First off I wrote I wrote this verse, and then went on to say
I'd had some fun though it was hard, and so went on this way:

I wrote what first I wrote, and then what I said next.
I said that it was hard, but fun - then I started to get vexed.
I asked myself, where am I - what have I come to now?
What should I write - yes what, and when and where and how?

So I left it as I'd written it and then moved on to write,
that I'd written what I'd written and surely that was right.
I thought perhaps a change of mood was what the poem needed
and that I'd just write whatever came, and just go where it leaded.

The poem wasn't much, although it rhymed - and that is true,
though my rhymes were rather weak and forced, and my metre was askew.
And at last I reached the final verse - I was pleased, I'm telling you.
And I finished off the poem that I'd wrote 'bout MrWho.
