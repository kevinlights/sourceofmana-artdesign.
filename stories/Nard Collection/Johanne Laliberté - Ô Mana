Ô Mana

Ô Mana, I take the boat to travel over the sea just to seek you.
Ô Mana, How can I become this hero? What do you want from me in this world of sadness?
Ô Mana, Is it the key to finding the way trough battles after battles to get the knowledge or something else?
Ô Mana, Please hear me, tell me how to be stronger and show me the way.
Ô Mana, I just want to take a pause and look around to meet if there are nice and wonderful people around me.
Ô Mana, Perhaps could I find my path trough out this world where I could fight hand in hand with friends.
Ô Mana, Town to town, I found him, he passed across my way and became my best friend and husband
Ô Mana, We haunted, shared and we crossed the woodland.
Ô Mana, He gave me confidence, I feel my fears are less.
Ô Mana. Together, We can help and protect others from the shadow of the darkness.
Ô Mana, Now I get the courage to continue until the end.
Ô Mana, In fact, it is through you that we can find friendship to do ManaWorld!
