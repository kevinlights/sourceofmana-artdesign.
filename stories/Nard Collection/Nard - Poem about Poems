Poem about Poems

Poem is making the words dance
Words become music and glance
Over lovers under a starry night
Whose eyes glisten under Moonlight

No matter the grammar
If words beat in rhythm
Find an order with them
As on anvil strikes the hammer

No matter the spelling
Just say something sparkling
If not, how could CrazyKatiektch
Say her love to glamourous Gliktch?

True be or not true be
That's not the question
And rhyming is not too
If you don't like to
Share your mind is your mission
Whatever inside can be

Don't be shy, you are nice
From your mind, break the ice
Whatever your idea
It's the good one and, ahem!
That makes everybody
Able to write a poem
