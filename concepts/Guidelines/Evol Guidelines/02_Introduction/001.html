<h1>2. Introduction</h1>
<p>In this chapter I will explain for who I have written this document, how
to contact me, and lastly about the licenses used in this project.</p>
<h2>2.1 Audience</h2>
<p>This document is written for developers who just have begun helping
with the Evol Online project. However this document might also be
helpfull for experienced developers, as it can act as an in depth
guidelines reference.</p>
<p>In this document we will mostly explain the art style of Evol Online.
With the help of example images we will explain the look and feel of
Evol Online. Some of the chapters will have an in depth guide how to
create these look and style.</p>
<p>We hope this document might explain some of the questions a developer
may have. However this document is currently far from finished, so
please expect that there are incomplete texts and mistakes in this
document. If anything is not clear, or if you find a mistake in this
document, please do not hesitate to contact us at the IRC or the forum.
