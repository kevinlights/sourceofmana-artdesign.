<h1>2. Why do we need guidelines?</h1>
   <p>
      There are several reasons why we need to have
      guidelines:
      <ol>
         <li>Consistent game experience</li>
         <li>Higher quality</li>
         <li>It helps beginner developers</li>
      </ol>
   </p>
   <h2>2.1 Consistent game experience</h2>
      <p>
         Guidelines make sure everything looks, feels, and works the
         same. Without them each developer would invent their own wheel.
         And every wheel would look different from each other. One might
         be round, the other square and another triangle. Each wheel
         would work different too. One wheel has to be pushed, while
         another has to be pulled. The third wheel may have an engine,
         and roll on his own.
      </p>
   <h2>2.2 Higher quality</h2>
      <p>
         Guidelines also make sure there is a quality standard. This
         makes sure that every piece of art at least has some quality.
      </p>
   <h2>2.3 It helps beginner developers</h2>
      <p>
         Beginner developers may not know everything about Evol Online.
         With the help of the guidelines the beginning developers can
         check whether their piece of art meets the requirements
         them self and, if needed, fix their piece of art.
