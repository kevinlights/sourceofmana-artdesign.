<h1>4. File specifications</h1>
<h2>4.1 File formats</h2>
<p>In order for art to be useful for Evol Online, it needs to be in the
specified format. Evol Online accept that two file formats for graphics
and one file format for palettes.</p>
<p>The official graphic file format is the PNG format. This is
valid for all kind of graphics: spritesheets, tilesets, graphic effects,
and others.</p>
<p>The other file format we accept is the XCF File format. The XCF is a
popular file format that can be opened by many editors, including GIMP
and Paint.net. This file format however can not be read by the client
and has to be converted to the PNG format before it can be used. However
the PNG format cannot contain any layers, so by using PNG we will lose
data. That is why we prefer to have both the PNG and the XCF files.</p>
<p>For color palettes we use the GPL file format. This format can be
opened by GIMP. This file format can however also be opened in a notepad
application, and be used in other graphic programs like Paint.net.</p>
<h2>4.2 Size specifications</h2>
<p>The width and the height of the sprites needs to be a power of 2.
This is cause of an old limitation of OpenGL, which is used by the
client. The modern OpenGL doesn't require this anymore, however it will
still perform better that way, and thus it is a good practice to keep in
mind. The maximum width and height of a sprite is 512 pixels. This means
that valid values for the width and height are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, 256 and 512 pixels.</p>
